            <h5>Algorithm analysis</h5>
            <p class='normal'>
                In computer science, algorithm analysis is the process of analyzing the amount of computing resources (such as computing time, memory usage, etc.) needed to execute a given algorithm. The efficiency or complexity of the algorithm is theoretically expressed as a function. Its definition field is the length of the input data (usually considering any large input without upper bound), and the value field is usually the number of execution steps (time complexity) or the number of memory locations (space complexity). Algorithm analysis is an important part of computational complexity theory.
                Theoretical analysis often uses asymptotic analysis to estimate the complexity of an algorithm, and uses big O symbols, big Ω symbols and big Θ The symbol acts as a marker. For example, the number of execution steps required for binary search is proportional to the logarithm of the length of the search list, which is called "logarithmic time" for short. Asymptotic analysis is usually used because the efficiency of different specific implementations of the same algorithm may be different. However, for any given algorithm, the performance difference between all implementations that meet the designer's intent should only be a coefficient.
                Algorithm analysis is very important in practical work, because using inefficient algorithms will significantly reduce system performance. In situations where the running time is extremely high, the results of algorithms that take too long may be outdated or useless. Inefficient algorithms also consume a lot of computing resources.
